So for the longest time I was pronoucing SQL (Structured Query Language) as the acronym S-Q-L. Took me a bit to realize all the cool kids pronouce it See-quil. Yes, it has a better flow that way and happens to be less syllables, so that's a plus. Just thought that was funny but not the main point of this post. 

Any-hoot, I was just going to share a small tidbit on what has helped me get through the SQL sections in the Learn.co cirriculum. There was one main item that continually helped me through the majority of the labs... A Data Base Browser! 

There are plenty of free and pay ones out there but I fell on DB Browser for SQLite. You can find at: [https://sqlitebrowser.org/ ](http://)

The cool thing with using a DB browser is you can import or copy/paste the data file  from the labs into the browser. Then you have the ability to play around with your queries before you write it out in the labs. This was so helpful to me during those sections. 

I also would just recreate the whole labs in the browser. Create the tables, insert data and read the data. Just having the ability to see the databases working at your fingertips and not just checking to see if the tests pass was infallible.  

That's all I have to say about that.
