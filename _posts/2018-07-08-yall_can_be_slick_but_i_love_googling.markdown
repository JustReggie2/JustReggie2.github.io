So I'm working on Hashes and the Hashes Iteration Lab. This one was a bit tricky because to pass, you couldn't use a bunch of different methods (that, of course, would have made the task a bit easier). When using google for help, all the responses obviously used those methods so it wasn't too much help at the start. 

Though a lot of these labs can be tricky, you have to be just as tricky and I'm sure that's what Flatiron is trying to do in this cirriculum. They push you to search out some of these answers, especially if they haven't covered them yet in the cirriculum. Guess what i'm trying to say is that Google is your friend. Sometimes you have to make sure you're asking it the right question. 

If you do find yourself stuck on the Hashes Iteration Lab (key_for_min_value), help is out there in the interwebs. Just when you do find an answer, make sure you understand it before just using to pass the tests or use it to help you write your own version because with coding, there are a multitude of ways to write the same method. And subsequently, they are all out there to find.
