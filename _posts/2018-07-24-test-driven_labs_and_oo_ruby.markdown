This will be short but do you ever over-think the test failures in a lab? I do. Little key words can really throw me off when working these test-driven labs. Words like "has" over "initialize" seem to make my brain crazy. Simple confusion on my part but oh man. In short, "has a name" is definitely not "initialize with a name." Try not to overcode when working on test-driven labs. 

That is all.
