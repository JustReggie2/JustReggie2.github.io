So, understanding code, what it does and how to use it comes fairly easy to me but remembering all the terminology... well that's where I'm finding the most difficulty. 

Even when I read the above statement, I think to myself, that makes no sense. How can you know how to utilize whichever element, method, variable, etc. and not know what it's called?! I truly don't know, to be honest. As a kid, I was always taking apart my toys and electronics (RC cars, radios and such) and putting them back together again. I had no idea that a transistor was a transistor. I just managed to see where it was and figured out it's purpose and flow. That's what I feel is happening with my journey into coding. I can read the lines of code and figure out it's flow or pattern and understand what goes where and why it's there. 

I know that I do have to master the terminology just as much as I'm mastering being able to understand and write code; this is just an area at which I do struggle. I am taking steps to better understand relating the terms with what they do by continually going over my notes and pushing myself to talk out all of the code that I write. Also,writing a lot of comments with my code is helping to keep me up to speed (a little tip). 

Just sharing my journey. Hope you can relate.
