I have a good but sometimes annoying habit of wanting my labs to complete and load in the smallest amount of time. 

This is a good habit to have as with programming, you always want your programs to load and run fast. Think of using your computer and getting the always so awesome "spinning wheel." When your program runs efficiently, well, it runs efficiently. 

The annoying part for me comes from my perfectionism. I can probably spend too much time on a lab trying my best to find the best methods to write and use that may only take off those hundredths of seconds. But I do find so much satisfaction in having that time go down. Sometimes when I complete a lab, if my solution is different from learn.co's, I'll copy in theirs and see if mine runs faster... dorky, I know. 

Anyways, it is not a bad habit to check the run times when you run your tests and complete your labs. It can give you hints on the efficiency of your programming.
