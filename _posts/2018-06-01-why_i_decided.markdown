So my life has been interesting through these past 40-something years, but a few random decisions probably lead to my new direction of learning to code. 

I'll start with where I am geographically. I recently moved back to Philadelphia so my wife and I could be living and working in the same city. I no longer have to spend 4 hours commuting everyday just to support my family. Moving back to Philly, obviously, has it's perks and benefits for my well being and my life but it also has some drawbacks like having to take a demotion in my current job/company to be able to move back. 

This drawback could be considered a jumping point for me to make efforts to change my career situation. So I then started looking at options... real estate, insurance, more marketing (oh yeah, I didn't mention I work for a brand marketing company). Those options just didn't excite my soul to make the attempt for change and/or see myself continuing for the next 20 years of life. 

When I looked at coding, it made sense to me. I was already doing small forms of it at work, making fairly complex Excel documents (we work with a s@#t ton of data for our clients). I have also utilized lots of different music software being that I've been a DJ and bedroom producer for over 20 years. It just clicked with me. The lightbulb went off and I thought, this is the field that not alone isn't going anywhere, but it's continually growing. And as I'm thinking this, I'm kicking myself for not going in this direction earlier. When I was a young teenager, I used to copy gaming code from this magazine my dad (electronics engineer) use to get in BASIC and DOS. Not realizing that I was learning to code then, didn't keep up with it and went to college Pre-med/Biology... Ugh! See how that worked out (not a doctor). 

Anywho, started getting a bit deep there, I like feeling I get from working with the logic and problem solving that coding provides. I know I can learn these new languages and excel at them. This will give me more skills to add my tenured working experience and I see more options for having a much more stable career. Yeah... that's partly why I decided to become a web developer.
